#pt_tutorial_4.1_web

This GUI app illustrates how to register new users to the database and identify them when they appear in the scene. It displays the live color preview from the camera within a browser and draw red rectangles around the person(s) detected in the camera frame with a color dot indicating the center of mass for the detected persons in the frame. It also displays the Person ID (pid) for every person detected which is temporary id for the person. Mouse click in any of the detected person's rectangle, activates registration for that person and saves the information in a database (database name currently hardcoded) with a Recognition ID (rid) assigned to that person, when this operation executes correctlly, the color of rectangle around the person will turn to green. Clicking on the **load database** button, loads the database that has information about the recognized persons, displays a green rectangle and the **rid** of already registered peson when they are present in the FOV.
